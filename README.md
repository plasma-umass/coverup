## About CoverUp
CoverUp automatically generates tests that ensure that more of your code is tested
(that is, it increases its [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)).
CoverUp can also create a test suite from scratch if you don't yet have one.
The new tests are based on your code, making them useful for [regression testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing).

CoverUp is designed to work closely with the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) test framework.
To generate tests, it first measures your suite's coverage using [SlipCover](https://github.com/plasma-umass/slipcover), our state-of-the art coverage analyzer.
It then selects portions of the code that need more testing (that is, code that is uncovered).
CoverUp then engages in a conversation with an [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model),
prompting for tests, checking the results to verify that they run and increase coverage (again using SlipCover), and re-prompting for adjustments as necessary.
Finally, CoverUp checks that the new tests integrate well, attempting to resolve any issues it finds.

## Installing CoverUp

CoverUp is available from PyPI, so you can install simply with
```shell
$ python3 -m pip install coverup
```

Currently, CoverUp requires an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) to run (we plan to support local models in the near future).
Your account will also need to have a [positive balance](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).
Create an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and store its "secret key" (usually a
string starting with `sk-`) in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
```shell
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<...your-api-key...>
```

## Using CoverUp

If your module's source code is in `src` and your tests in `tests`, you can run CoverUp as
```shell
$ coverup --source-dir src --tests-dir tests
```
CoverUp then creates tests named `test_coverup_N.py`, where `N` is a number, under the `tests` directory.

### Example

Here we have CoverUp create additional tests for the popular package [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/):
```
$ coverup --source-dir src/flask --tests-dir tests
Measuring test suite coverage...  starting coverage: 90.2%
Prompting gpt-4-1106-preview for tests to increase coverage...
100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████| 95/95 [02:49<00:00,  1.79s/it, usage=~$3.30, G=51, F=141, U=22, R=0]
Checking test suite...  tests/test_coverup_2.py is failing, looking for culprit(s)...
Disabling tests/test_coverup_19.py
Checking test suite...  tests ok!
End coverage: 94.2%
```
In under 3 minutes, CoverUp increases Flask's test coverage from 90.2% to 94.2%.
It detected that one of the new tests, `test_coverup_19`, was causing another test
to fail and disabled it.
That test remains as `disabled_test_coverup_19.py`, where it can be reviewed for the cause
and possibly re-added to the suite.

### Running CoverUp with Docker

To evaluate the tests generated by the LLM, CoverUp must execute them.
For best security and to minimize the risk of damage to your system, we recommend
running CoverUp with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Evaluation

<img src="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coverup/blob/main/images/comparison.png?raw=True" align="right" width="65%"/>

The graph shows CoverUp in comparison to the state-of-the-art [CodaMosa](https://www.carolemieux.com/codamosa_icse23.pdf),
which itself uses LLM queries to improve on the [Pynguin](https://github.com/se2p/pynguin) test generator.
For this experiment, both CoverUp and CodaMosa created tests "from scratch", that is, ignoring any existing test suite.
The bars show the difference in coverage percentage between CoverUp and CodaMosa for various Python modules;
green bars, above 0, indicate that CoverUp achieved a higher coverage.

As the graph shows, CoverUp achieves higher coverage in almost every case.

## Work In Progress

This is an early release of CoverUp.
Please enjoy it, and pardon any disruptions as we work to improve it. We welcome bug reports, experience reports, and feature requests (please [open an issue](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coverup/issues/new)).
